# Factorial Contract

This is for eth-denver buidlathon.
It comes with contracts, tests for that contract, and scripts that deploys that contract.

If you want to set local(hardhat) env, try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
nvm use 14.17.0
yarn install
hardhat node
hardhat run scripts/deploy-local.ts --network localhost
```
